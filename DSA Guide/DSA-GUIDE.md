So, First of all you have to decide the Language. Choose Between JAVA and C/C++. If you're Going for Competitive Programming then go With C++ and If you're focusing on Development then go With JAVA.

Concept/Logic is same only Implementation is Different.

# üê±‚ÄçüöÄFor Java :
if you're going with JAVA then you dont need to follow several resources.
There's a Course Going on, on YouTube By Kunal Kushwaha named "JAVA + DSA"
